## Project Description

In an effort to avoid waste and grow communities, many people have begun operating swap shops, where people swap food, clothes, furniture, etc. In this project we will be designing and implementing an app to facilitate this process for a community. Among other features, users will be able to:

•	Create a profile in which they will use to sign in to use the application

•	Create a listing in which they will be able take a picture and add a description of the item they wish to swap, which may include food, clothes, etc.

•	Browse through listed items (which will include a sort, filter, and search feature in later stages)

•	Contact people who have listed an item they wish to swap, which will be via a chat system

•	Keep track of what will be traded during a swap

•	Organise to meet once a swap has been agreed upon such as a pickup/drop off service or delivery (with measures in place to avoid scams and other dangers)

•	Use a rating system to rate products/users

•	Use a trade window whereby they will be allowed to compare trades, add to trades, make listing private, etc. 

•	Be able to report other users
